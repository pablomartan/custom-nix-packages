# My custom packages

This repo consists of a series of programs I needed for some reason or another,
and custom packaged for [nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix).

As of 18/10/2024 (october 10th) there are two packages:
- [openfortivpn-webview-qt](https://github.com/gm-vm/openfortivpn-webview) (previously on its own repo)
- [Autofirma](https://sede.serviciosmin.gob.es/ES-ES/FIRMAELECTRONICA/Paginas/AutoFirma.aspx) (previously on its own repo)
- [Catapult](https://otsaloma.io/catapult/)
